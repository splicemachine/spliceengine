         * We need to maintain the index just in case the dropping transaction is rolled back, BUT
         * simultaneously, if we perform future writes within the same transaction as the drop index,
         * we can NOT update the index itself. This boils into two categories:
         *
         * 1. T1 drops index, then performs subsequent write
         * 2. T1 drop index, then T2 performs subsequent write
         *
         * Category 1:
         *
         * There are two main possible timelines:
         *
         * T1.begin -> T1.dropIndex->T1.write->T1.rollback
         * T1.begin -> T1.dropIndex ->T1.write->T1.commit
         *
         * In the first case, when we rollback, we rollback BOTH the write AND the dropIndex, so it doesn't matter
         * if we updated the index or not.
         *
         * In the second case, the drop index is successfully applied, and therefore it is irrelevant whether we
         * updated the index or not.
         *
         * However, if we update the index, we run into a situation where we might cause a UniqueIndex violation.
         * Then we would have to do some kind of way of supressing the violation (since it's not a unique violation
         * in our transaction). In that situation, we can lead ourselves to overwriting other data, resulting in
         * a corrupted index. Therefore, we cannot write data to the index itself.
         *
         * Category 2:
         * In this scenario, any write which occurs AFTER the drop is committed does not need to write data
         * to the index, but any write which occurs BEFORE the drop is committed will have to, in case the drop
         * has been rolled back.
         *
         * Thus, the logic is something as follows:
         *
         * 1. Determine if DropTxn has been committed. If so, then discard any write at all
         * 2. If dropTxn has been rolled back, then proceed with the write
         * 3. If dropTxn is still active, find the youngest common ancestor(YCA) of dropTxn and ctx.getTxn().
         * 4. If YCA !=ROOT, then do not perform the write, otherwise, perform the write
         */
