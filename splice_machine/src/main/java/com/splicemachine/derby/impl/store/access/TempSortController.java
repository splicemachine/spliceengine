/**
 * CostController for a TEMP-table based algorithm for computing Grouped Aggregates.
 *
 * The TEMP base algorithm is separated into a <em>parallel</em> and <em>sequential</em>
 * phase. The parallel phase always occurs, and contributes its cost
 * to the local portion of the sequential phase.
 *
 * -----
 * <h2>Costing the Parallel Phase</h2>
 * For each partition in the underlying scan, we submit a parallel task which reads
 * all data, then pushes that data into temp sorted according to key columns. We
 * assume that data is uniformly distributed across the known partitions (which
 * is a poor assumption in many cases, but for v1.0 will work acceptably), so
 * we know that each task will read 1/numPartitions worth of the rows. As a result,
 * the parallel cost is
 *
 * parallelCost = (baseCost.localCost+baseCost.remoteCost)/numPartitions
 *
 * The output partition count is 1 (until we modify the Sort operation to
 * use multiple buffers, which we can't do unless we know it's the top operation).
 *
 * -----
 * <h2>Costing the Sequential Phase</h2>
 * The sequential phase merely reads the total data set out over the network,
 * so it inherits the remote cost of the previous operation.
 *
 * finalLocalCost = parallelCost + baseCost.remoteCost;
