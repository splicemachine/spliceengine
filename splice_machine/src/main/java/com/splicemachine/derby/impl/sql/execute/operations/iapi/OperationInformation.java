		 * Return the map from the physical (encoded) column locations to the decoded column locations.
		 *
		 * For example, let's say you are looking at the row (a,b,c,d), and you want to return (a,c,d). In this case,
		 *
		 * 1. the physical location of a is 0,so {@code baseColumnMap[0]} is the logical position of a in
		 * the decoded row. Since the logical location of a in the decoded row is 0, {@code baseColumnMap[0] = 0}
		 * 2. The physical location of b is 1, so {@code baseColumnMap[1]} is the logical position of b in
		 * the decoded row. Since b is to be ignored, the logical position of b is -1. Thus {@code baseColumnMap[1] = -1}
		 * 3. The physical location of c is 2, so {@code baseColumnMap[2] } is the location of c in the decoded row.
		 * Since c is logically placed in position 1, {@code baseColumnMap[2] = 1}
		 * 4. The physical location of d is 3, so {@code baseColumnMap[3]} is the location of d in the decoded row.
		 * Since d is logically placed in position 2 in the decoded row, {@code baseColumnMap[3] = 2}.
		 *
		 * Thus, in this example, {@code baseColumnMap = [0,-1,1,2]}
		 *
		 * @return the map from physical location to logical location for columns in the row.
