/**
 * Multi-threaded version of SimpleInsert.
 * A number of threads execute the INSERT statements
 * (each with their own connection).
 * All the rows for a given warehouse are executed by
 * one thread. The threads each get a warehouse to
 * complete and then insert all the rows. Then they
 * loop back to get the next warehouse. Warehouses
 * are assigned to threads in a first come first served
 * fashion. The main thread also inserts the ITEM table.
 * <BR>
 * By default the number of threads is the number
 * of cpus on the machine, unless the scale to be loaded
 * is larger than the number of threads. Then the number
 * of threads will be equal to the scale. If the scale
 * is one or the number of threads is one then the
 * load is just like SimpleInsert.
 * <BR>
 * The number of threads can be set but if it
 * it larger than the scale then the number of threads
 * will be equal to the scale.
 * 
 * <BR>
 * It is assumed that foreign key constraints are
 * created after the load.
