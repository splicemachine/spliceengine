 * This class tests online backup with various types of paths.
 * 1 ) backup path is same as a database directory. This should fail backup
 *     can not be made onto a database directory. (DERBY-304 bug).
 * 2 ) backup path is a sub directory in the database. 
 * 3 ) Redo backup with same path as in second case.
 * 4 ) backup path is absolute path.

 * If the path refers to some sub directory inside a database, backup 
 * will succeed because there is no easy way to catch this weird case,
 * especially if the backup path refers to another database directory.
