 * before it went down. After recovery more records are inserted into
 * the database before the database is shutdown.  Then, roll-forward
 * recovery of the database from the backup is performed.  It is then

 * present.  This test was made to recreate the problem in DERBY-298.
 * The test should be run after store/RecoveryAfterBackupSetup.java.
