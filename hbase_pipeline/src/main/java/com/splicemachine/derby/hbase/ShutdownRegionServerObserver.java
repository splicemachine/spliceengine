/**
 * This class exists just to initiate splice shutdown.  It implements RegionServerObserver and does this in the
 * preStopRegionServer() lifecycle method.
 * <p/>
 * This coprocessor must be listed in hbase.coprocessor.regionserver.classes (region server) which is a different
 * configuration parameter than hbase.coprocessor.region.classes where we list most of our coprocessors.  Only the
 * RegionServerObserver interface appears to have a method that is invoked when the entire server (not just one region
 * on the server) is stopping.  preStopRegionServer() is only invoked if this class is configured in
 * hbase.coprocessor.regionserver.classes.
 *
 * This class used to be combined with SpliceDerbyCoprocessor but that was confusing because that class has per-region
 * concerns but had to implement 15 methods of RegionServerObserver just to invoke shutdown pre region server stop--
 * better to have separate classes I think.
