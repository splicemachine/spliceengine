\section{Authentication and Authorization Problem Statement}
Transactional and Analytical databases are required to provide an
authentication and authorization mechanism.

\subsection{Authentication}
Authentication is simply resolving whether a user and password combinations
corresponds to a valid user.  However, there are several options for validating
this correct username, password combination.  There are currently 4 types of
authentication mechanism in Splice Machine.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item None: All usernames and password are allowed to connect to database.
	\item Native: Usernames in a database table are validated against their
	encrypted password.
	\item LDAP: Usernames checked against an existing LDAP service.
	\item Custom: Custom Java Class provided to perform authentication against the
	database.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Native (default)}
This approach to authentication utilizes the sys.sysusers table in the splice
schema.  The password is encrypted using MD5, SHA-256, or
SHA-512 (Default) algorithm.  The 

splice.authentication=NATIVE
splice.authentication.native.algorithm=MD5,SHA-256,SHA-512(Default)

call syscs_util.syscs_create_user('username','password');
call syscs_util.syscs_drop_user('username');
call syscs_util.syscs_reset_password('username','password');


\subsubsection{None}
An open database that will allow each user to authenticate against the datbase
can be configured by setting the following configuration.

splice.authentication=NONE

This is not recommended for production use.

\subsubsection{LDAP}

splice.authentication=LDAP
splice.authentication.ldap.server=localhost:9090 (Default)
splice.authentication.ldap.searchAuthDN
splice.authentication.ldap.searchAuthPW
splice.authentication.ldap.searchBase
splice.authentication.ldap.searchFilter

\subsubsection{Custom}

The custom authentication
configuration allows for any
class provided by the customer
that implements org.apache.derby.authentication.UserAuthenticator
to be applied as long as the following configuration is set.

splice.authentication=CUSTOM
splice.authentication.custom.provider=com.splicemachine.derby.authentication.SpliceUserAuthentication
(Default)

The interface is extremely simple and requires a developer to implement the
single method:

boolean	authenticateUser(String userName,String userPassword,String
databaseName,Properties info) throws SQLException;


\subsection{Authorization}

Splice Machine will utilize derby authorization syntax and levels.  These can be
described in the following page.

\url{https://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.9/devguide/cdevcsecuregrantrevokeaccess.html}

\subsubsection{Roles}

Splice Machine will utilize derby's role based model.  This model is described
in the followign page.
