\section{MapReduce InputFormat Integration with HBase Store Files} The merging
of the store files and the memstore usually require access to HBase via a scanner.  However, if the access of that data is
a large scan, it would be beneficial for the processing of that region's data to
be performed off process from the transactional HBase system.

Regions with Incremental Updates}  

\subsubsection{HBase Off Heap Region}
HBase already has a mechanism for creating a \emph{HRegion} without the normal
assignment process.  A developer can simply open a region without supplying a
Write Ahead Log or Region Server Services (movement, etc.).  The example code is
illustrated below:

		HRegion region = HRegion.openHRegion(conf, fs, rootDir, hri, htd, null,null,null);

\subsubsection{Memstore Only HBase Scan}
Memstore only scans in HBase already exist and the \emph{InternalScan} needed to
be modified to allow direct creation inside a coprocessor.  The
\emph{InternalScan} already allows for signaling to HBase that the scan should
only interogate the memstore.

			InternalScan iscan = new InternalScan(scan);
			iscan.checkOnlyMemStore();
