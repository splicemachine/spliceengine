<p>This package contains JMX MBeans that are intended to provide monitoring
and management capabilities of the Derby Network Server.</p>
<p>
Derby's management service (including JMX management and monitoring 
capabilities) will be enabled automatically on Network Server startup if a
set of requirements are met. See 
<a href="../package-summary.html">org.apache.derby.mbeans</a>
for details.</p>
<p>
Upon startup, the Network Server will attempt to register MBeans related to
the Network server. In addition to the MBeans included in this package, an
instance of the <a href="../VersionMBean.html">VersionMBean</a> will be 
registered, providing access to Network Server version information.</p>
<p>
When the Network Server starts, Derby's embedded driver is automatically booted
in the server JVM. This means that any MBeans that are automatically registered
at Derby system startup (booting/loading of the embedded driver) will also be
attempted registered with the MBean server at this point. Such MBeans are 
described in the <a href="../package-summary.html">org.apache.derby.mbeans</a> 
package.</p>
<p>
Derby registers its JMX MBeans in the <code>org.apache.derby</code> domain and
always includes values for <code>type</code> and <code>system</code> in the 
key properties of each MBean's ObjectName. The <code>system</code> key property
is described in the package description for 
<a href="../package-summary.html#package_description">org.apache.derby.mbeans</a>.
Conventions for how the main key property values are defined are also described 
there. Other key properties are described in the interface class for each MBean.

<!-- TODO - INCLUDE INFO ABOUT NETWORK SERVER JMX SECURITY PERMISSIONS, SEE
     E.G. DERBY-3462, DERBY-3491

<h3>Security</h3>
    
<p> OLD:
Permissions in policy files need to use the MBean interface to define fine 
grained access. For example, the permission to allow access to the 
<a href="NetworkServerMBean.html#getUpTime()"<code>UpTime</code> attribute</a>
of the <a href="NetworkServerMBean.html">NetworkServerMBean</a> may be written 
as:
