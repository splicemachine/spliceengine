 * Convenient executor factory methods.

 * On daemon property: For the splicemachine main product where we run as part of of HBase we probably want
 * most thread pools to consist of daemons that do not not prevent HBase region server JVMs from shutting down.
 * An thread pool that strictly must finish any in progress work before the jvm exists would be an exception to this
 * rule.  In this later case make the threads non-daemon and make sure ExecutorService.shutdown() is explicitly
 * invoked as part of the splice shutdown process.
