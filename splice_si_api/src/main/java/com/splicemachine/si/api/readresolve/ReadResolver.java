 * Interface for notifying other systems that a read was resolved.

 * Read resolution is the act of ensuring that a particular version of a particular
 * row has the correct metadata attached to it when its writing transaction is either
 * committed or rolled back.
 *
 * When a writing transaction is rolled back, Read Resolution should delete the physical representation
 * of the data so as to avoid the IO cost of reading junk data.
 *
 * When a writing transaction is committed, Read Resolution should attach a commit timestamp
 * to the data to avoid repeated transaction lookups for future reads.
