/**
 * Asynchronous element for "resolving" transaction elements.
 *
 * This consists of two primary purposes: transaction timeouts and
 * global commits.
 *
 * <h3>Transaction Timeouts</h3>
 * Transactions are timed out if they remain active past a certain point
 * without an explicit keep-alive. This process requires some effort(albeit a minor amount).
 * We avoid that situation (as well as clarifying the data in the table) by explicitly setting
 * the transaction state to ROLLEDBACK.
 *
 * <h3>Global Commit Timestamps</h3>
 * When a dependent child transaction commits, it is not considered truly committed until every
 * dependent parent in the chain has been committed. Thus, in order to process whether a child
 * transaction is truly committed, we have to fetch its entire transaction hierarchy until we either
 * A) hit an active transaction or B) find the ROOT transaction. This is clearly very expensive.
 *
 * To avoid this expense, we have an additional field: the "global Commit Timestamp". This is the timestamp
 * at which the <em>highest dependent parent</em> of the child transaction has been committed. For example,
 * suppose that we have the following chain:
 *  T1: beginTimestamp=1,commitTimestamp=6
 *      T2: beginTimestamp=2,commitTimestamp=5
 *          T3: beginTimestamp=3,commitTimestamp=4
 *
 * In this example, T2 is a parent of T3, and T1 is a parent of T2. T3 then is not committed until T2 is, and T2
 * is not committed until T1 is. Thus, the "Global commit timestamp" of T3 is the commit timestamp of T1 (6), and
 * the "Global commit timestamp" of T2 is the commit timestamp of T1 (6).
 *
 * Whenever the global commit timestamp is present, then we know that the child transaction was committed, and has
 * an effective commit timestamp which is the same as the global commit timestamp.
 *
 * Unfortunately, there's no efficient mechanism which can construct the global commit timestamp on the fly. To avoid
 * this costly reconstruction each time, we add an asynchronous mechanism here. When, upon reading a transaction
 * entry, we detect a child transaction that has been committed, but does not have a global commit timestamp,
 * we submit it to this resolver to determine whether or not to add a commit timestamp. This resolver then
 * will asynchronously determine the proper global commit timestamp, and add it to the transaction entry
 * so that future calls will not need to resolve it.
