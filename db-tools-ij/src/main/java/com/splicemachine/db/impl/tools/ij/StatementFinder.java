	StatementGrabber looks through an input stream for

	<p>
	Semicolons inside comments, strings, and delimited identifiers
	are not considered to be statement terminators but to be
	part of those tokens.
	<p>
    Comments currently recognized include the SQL comment,
    which begins with "--" and ends at the next EOL, and nested
    bracketed comments.
	<p>
	Strings and delimited identifiers are permitted to contain
	newlines; the actual IJ or JSQL parsers will report errors when
	those cases occur.
