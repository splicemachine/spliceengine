/**
 * A decorator that copies test resources from the classpath
 * into the file system at setUp time. Resources are named
 * relative to org/apache/derbyTesting/, e.g. the name
 * passed into the constructor should be something like
 * funtionTests/test/lang/mytest.sql
 * <BR>
 * Read only resources are placed into ${user.dir}/extin/name
 * Read-write resources are placed into ${user.dir}/extinout/name
 * write only output files can be created in ${user.dir}/extout
 * 
 * These locations map to entries in the test policy file that
 * have restricted permissions granted.
 * 
 * All the three folders are created even if no files are
 * copied into them.
 * 
 * In each case the name of a file is the base name of the resource,
 * no package structure is retained.
 * 
 * A test may access such a resource using either files or URLs.
 * The static utility methods must be used to obtain the location
 * of any resource. In the future this decorator may create sub-folders
 * to ensure that tests run in paralled do not interfere with each other.
 * 
 * tearDown removes the three folders and their contents.
