/**
 * Utility code that wraps a spawned process (Java Process object).
 * <p>
 * There are three main aspects handled by this class:
 * <ul> <li>Draining the output streams of the process.<br/>
 *          Happens automatically, the output gathered can be accessed with
 *          {@linkplain #getFailMessage}, {@linkplain #getFullServerError},
 *          {@linkplain #getFullServerOutput}, and
 *          {@linkplain #getNextServerOutput}</li>
 *      <li>Waiting for process completion, followed by cleanup (see
 *          {@linkplain #complete()} and {@linkplain #complete(long)})</li>
 *      <li>Forcibly destroying a process that live too long, for instance
 *          if inter-process communication hangs. This happens automatically
 *          if a threshold value is exceeded.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <em>Implementation notes</em>: Active waiting is employed when waiting for
 * the process to complete. This is considered acceptable since the expected
 * usage pattern is to spawn the process, execute a set of tests, and then
 * finally asking the process to shut down. Waiting for the process to
 * complete is the last step, and a process typically lives only for a short
 * period of time anyway (often only for seconds, seldom more than a few
 * minutes).
 * <br/>
 * Forcibly destroying processes that live too long makes the test run
 * continue even when facing inter-process communication hangs. The prime
 * example is when both the client and the server are waiting for the other
 * party to send data. Since the timeout is very high this feature is intended
 * to avoid automated test runs from hanging indefinitely, for instance due to
 * environmental issues affecting the process.
