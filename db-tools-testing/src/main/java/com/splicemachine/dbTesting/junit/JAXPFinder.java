/* The following import is of a JAXP API class.  The JAXP API classes
 * are included within JVMs that are 1.4 and later.  However, 1.3 and
 * J2ME JVMs do not include the JAXP API classes.  As a result this
 * file can only be built with 1.4 or later (see build.xml in this
 * directory).  We have to separate this class out from junit/XML.java
 * because XML.java will be instantiated for any JUnit test, regardless
 * of whether or not the the required JAXP classes are in the user's
 * classpath.  This means that if we imported the JAXP class into
 * junit/XML.java, a user who tried to run a JUnit test without
 * the JAXP interface in his/her classpath (which typically means
 * J2ME is being used) would see a NoClassFoundError. (DERBY-2153).
 * That's not what we want; instead, all tests that do *not* rely on
 * JAXP should run as normal and any tests that require JAXP should be
 * silently skipped.
 *
 * To accomplish this goal we import/reference DocumentBuilderFactory 
 * in *this* class (JAXPFinder). Then we *only* make calls on this
 * JAXPFinder if we know for certain that all required XML classes
 * are in the user's classpath.  With this restriction in place we
 * can ensure that the JAXP class will never be instantiated for
 * environments which do not have a JAXP parser.  Thus the JUnit
 * harness will run/skip tests as expected whether or not the user's
 * classpath includes a JAXP parser.
