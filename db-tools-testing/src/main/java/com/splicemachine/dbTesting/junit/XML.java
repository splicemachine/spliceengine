 * <p>
 * XML utility methods for the JUnit tests.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that The XML tests require a more advanced version of Xalan
 * than the default version bundled with JDK 1.4. The XML tests silently
 * exit if the required environment is not found.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To run the XML tests under JDK 1.4, you must do the following:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Download the latest version of Xalan (2.7.0 as of this writing).</li>
 * <li>Copy all of the downloaded jars into the jre/lib/endorsed directory
 * of your JDK 1.4 installation. Those jar files are:
 * serializer.jar, xalan.jar, xercesImpl.jar, and xsltc.jar.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 *That's it! Now the XML tests should run for you under JDK 1.4.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To run the XML tests under a higher version of the JDK, you must do the
 * following:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Download the latest version of Xalan as described above.</li>
 * <li>Wire the downloaded jar files into your CLASSPATH.</li>
 * </ul>
