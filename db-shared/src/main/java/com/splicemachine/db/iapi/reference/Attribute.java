/**
	List of all connection (JDBC) attributes by the system.


	<P>
	This class exists for two reasons
	<Ol>
	<LI> To act as the internal documentation for the attributes. 
	<LI> To remove the need to declare a java static field for the attributes
	name in the protocol/implementation class. This reduces the footprint as
	the string is final and thus can be included simply as a String constant pool entry.
	</OL>
	<P>
	This class should not be shipped with the product.

	<P>
	This class has no methods, all it contains are String's which by
	are public, static and final since they are declared in an interface.
    
    <P>
    At some point this class should be replaced by
    com.splicemachine.db.shared.common.reference.Attribute.
    The issue is that this class is used by ij to check attributes,
    ij uses reflection on this class to get the list of valid attributes.
    The expanded class in shared has the client attributes as well.
    Ideally ij would work of an explicit list of attributes and not
    infer the set from reflection. See DERBY-1151
