        db.database.forceDatabaseLock
		<BR>
        Derby attempts to prevent two instances of Derby from booting
        the same database with the use of a file called db.lck inside the 
        database directory.

        On some platforms, Derby can successfully prevent a second 
        instance of Derby from booting the database, and thus prevents 
        corruption. If this is the case, you will see an SQLException like the
        following:

        ERROR XJ040: Failed to start database 'toursDB', see the next exception
        for details.
        ERROR XSDB6: Another instance of Derby may have already booted the
        database C:\databases\toursDB.

        The error is also written to the information log.

        On other platforms, Derby issues a warning message if an instance
        of Derby attempts to boot a database that may already have a
        running instance of Derby attached to it.
        However, it does not prevent the second instance from booting, and thus
        potentially corrupting, the database.

        If a warning message has been issued, corruption may already have 
        occurred.


        The warning message looks like this:

        WARNING: Derby (instance 80000000-00d2-3265-de92-000a0a0a0200) is
        attempting to boot the database /export/home/sky/wombat even though
        Derby (instance 80000000-00d2-3265-8abf-000a0a0a0200) may still be
        active. Only one instance of Derby 
        should boot a database at a time. Severe and non-recoverable corruption
        can result and may have already occurred.

        The warning is also written to the information log.

        This warning is primarily a Technical Support aid to determine the 
        cause of corruption. However, if you see this warning, your best 
        choice is to close the connection and exit the JVM. This minimizes the
        risk of a corruption. Close all instances of Derby, then restart
        one instance of Derby and shut down the database properly so that
        the db.lck file can be removed. The warning message continues to appear
        until a proper shutdown of the Derby system can delete the db.lck
        file.

        If the "derby.database.forceDatabaseLock" property is set to true
        then this default behavior is altered on systems where Derby cannot
        prevent this dual booting.  If the to true, then if the platform does
        not provide the ability for Derby to guarantee no double boot, and
        if Derby finds a db.lck file when it boots, it will throw an 
        exception (TODO - mikem - add what exception), leave the db.lck file
        in place and not boot the system.  At this point the system will not 
        boot until the db.lck file is removed by hand.  Note that this 
        situation can arise even when 2 VM's are not accessing the same
        Derby system.  Also note that if the db.lck file is removed by 
        hand while a VM is still accessing a db.database, then there
        is no way for Derby to prevent a second VM from starting up and 
        possibly corrupting the database.  In this situation no warning 
        message will be logged to the error log.

        To disable the default behavior of the db.lck file set property as 
        follows:
