 *
 * <p>
 * In contrast to most other visitors, this visitor walks the tree bottom-up.
 * Top-down processing of the tree would only evaluate constant expressions
 * at the leaf level, so for instance {@code (1=1)=(1=2)} would only be
 * simplified to {@code TRUE=FALSE}. With bottom-up processing, the top-level
 * = node will be processed after the leaves, and it sees the intermediate
 * tree {@code TRUE=FALSE} which it is able to transform into the even simpler
 * tree {@code FALSE}.
