/**
 * A predicate that evaluates to true if a given BinaryRelationalOperatorNode has this shape:
 * <pre>
 * BRON(ANY-OP)
 *  /  \
 * CR  NoColumnReferenceSubTree
 * </pre>
 *
 * Where the CR can be on either side but must have nesting level equal to that specified in the constructor. We are
 * usually looking for a level different than where the CR is found, thus it is a correlated column reference. Since it
 * is being compared to a subtree with no column references this predicate evaluates to true for predicates that can be
 * moved to the query with the specified nesting level.
 *
 * EXAMPLE:
 *
 * select * from A where exists( select 1 from B where a1 = 10 );
 *
 * In this query 'a1=10' can be moved to the outer query (for EXISTS subqueries, but not for NOT-EXISTS subqueries).
