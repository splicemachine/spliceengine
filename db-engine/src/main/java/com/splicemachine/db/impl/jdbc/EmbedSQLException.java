	This class is what gets send over the wire in client/server
    configuration. When running embedded, this has the detailed
    stack trace for exceptions. In case of client/server, server
    has all the stack trace information but client doesn't get
    the stack trace, just the sql exception. The reason for this
    implementation is the stack trace information is more relevant
    on the server side and it also decreases the size of client
    jar file tremendously.
