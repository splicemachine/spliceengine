/**
 * This interface is implemented by a read/write VTI class that wants to control when
 * modifications to the VTI are deferred, or to be notified that a it is to be modified.
 * Consider the following statement:<br>
 * UPDATE NEW myVTI(...)
 *  SET cost = cost + 10
 *  WHERE cost < 15
 *<p>
 * Updating a column that is used in the WHERE clause might or might not give the VTI implementation trouble;
 * the update might cause the same row to be selected more than once. This problem can be solved by building the
 * complete list of rows to be updated and the new column values before updating any rows. The updates are applied
 * after the list is built. This process is called "deferred update".
 *<p>
 * By default, updates on a VTI are deferred when the VTI ResultSet
 * is scrollable (ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE or TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE), and one or more of the following is true.
 *<ol>
 *<li>One or more of the columns in the SET clause is also used in the WHERE
 * clause and the VTI ResultSet is sensitive. We do not defer updates
 * when the ResultSet is TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE because it is not necessary.
 *<li>The where clause contains a subselect on a VTI from the same class as the
 * target VTI. We do not look at the VTI parameters, just the VTI class name.
 *</ol>
 *<p>
 * By default, deletes on a VTI are deferred in a similar situation: when the VTI ResultSet
 * is scrollable (ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE or TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE), and
 * the where clause contains a subselect on a VTI from the same class as the
 * target VTI. We do not look at the VTI parameters, just the VTI class name.
 *<p>
 * By default, inserts into a VTI are deferred when the same VTI class is used as both
 * the source and target. It does not depend on the scrollability of the
 * VTI ResultSet because inserts can be deferred without scrolling the ResultSet.
 *<p>
 * If these defaults are not appropriate then the class implementing the VTI should also implement
 * this interface (com.splicemachine.db.vti.DeferModification).
 *<p>
 * (A read/write VTI is implemented by a class that implements the java.sql.PreparedStatement interface,
 * often by extending the UpdatableVTITemplate interface. @see UpdatableVTITemplate).
 *<p>
 * Update and delete statement deferral is implemented by scrolling the VTI's ResultSet. Therefore,
 * updates and deletes on a VTI are never deferred unless the VTI's ResultSets are scrollable, even
 * if the DeferModification interface methods return <b>true</b>.
 * Therefore for an update or delete to be deferred the VTI getResultSetType() method must return
 * ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE or TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE and the VTI must produce scrollable
 * java.sql.ResultSets that implement the getRow() and absolute() methods. If your VTI is implemented as
 * an extension to UpdatableVTITemplate then you must override the getResultSetMethod:
 * UpdatableVTITemplate.getResultSetType()
 * throws an exception. If your VTI's ResultSets are implemented as extensions to VTITemplate then you must
 * override the getRow() and absolute() methods: VTITemplate.getRow() and absolute() throw exceptions.
 *<p>
 * This interface is not used when the VTI is referenced only in a subselect; it is only used when a
 * VTI appears as the target of an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
