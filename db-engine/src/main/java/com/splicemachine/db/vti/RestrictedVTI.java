/**
   <p>
 * Interface for Table Functions which can be told which columns need to be fetched plus simple bounds on those columns.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface can be implemented by the ResultSet returned by the public
 * static method which is bound to the Table Function. If that ResultSet
 * implements this interface, then the initScan() method of this interface will be
 * called before the scan of the ResultSet starts, that is, before calling any
 * ResultSet method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * ResultSets which implement this interface can perform more efficiently
 * because they don't have to fetch all columns and rows. This can mean
 * performance boosts for queries which only need a subset of the Table
 * Function's columns and for queries which compare those columns to constant
 * expressions using the <, <=, =, >, >=, and != operators. This can also mean
 * performance boosts for LIKE and BETWEEN operations on Table Function
 * columns. For more information, see the commentary on
 * <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-4357">DERBY-4357</a>.

    /**
     * <p>
     * Initialize a scan of a ResultSet. This method is called once before the scan begins. It
     * is called before any
     * ResultSet method is called. This method performs two tasks:
     * </p>
     *
     * <li><b>Column names</b> - Tells the ResultSet which columns need to be fetched.</li>
     * <li><b>Limits</b> - Gives the ResultSet simple bounds to apply in order
     * to limit which rows are returned. Note that the ResultSet does not have
     * to enforce all of these bounds. Derby will redundantly enforce these
     * limits on all rows returned by the ResultSet. That is, filtering not
     * performed inside the ResultSet will still happen outside the ResultSet.</li>
     *
     * <p>
     * The <i>columnNames</i> argument is an array of columns which need to be fetched.  This
     * is an array of the column names declared in the Table Function's
     * CREATE FUNCTION statement. Column names which were double-quoted
     * in the CREATE FUNCTION statement appear case-sensitive in this
     * array. Column names which were not double-quoted appear
     * upper-cased. Derby asks the Table Function to fetch all columns mentioned
     * in the query. This includes columns mentioned in the SELECT list as well
     * as columns mentioned in the WHERE clause. Note that a column could be
     * mentioned in the WHERE clause in a complex expression which could not be
     * passed to the Table Function via the <i>restriction</i> argument.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The array has one slot for each column declared in the CREATE FUNCTION
     * statement. Slot 0 corresponds to the first column declared in the CREATE
     * FUNCTION statement and so on. If a column does not need to be
     * fetched, then the corresponding slot is null. If a column needs
     * to be fetched, then the corresponding slot holds the column's
     * name.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Note that even though the array may have gaps, it is expected that
     * columns in the ResultSet will occur at the positions declared in the
     * CREATE FUNCTION statement. Consider the following declaration:
     * </p>
     *
     * <blockquote><pre>
     *  create function foreignEmployeeTable()
     *  returns table
     *  (
     *      id        int,
     *      birthDay  date,
     *      firstName varchar( 100 ),
     *      lastName  varchar( 100 )
     *  )
     * ...
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * <p>
     * and the following query:
     * </p>
     *
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * select lastName from table( foreignEmployeeTable() ) s
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * <p>
     * In this example, the array passed to this method will have
     * 4 slots. Slots 0, 1, and 2 will be null and slot 3 will hold
     * the String "LASTNAME". Last names will be retrieved from the
     * ResultSet by calls to getString( 4 )--remember that JDBC column
     * ids are 1-based.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The <i>restriction</i> argument is a simple expression which should be evaluated inside the Table
     * Function in order to eliminate rows. The expression is a binary tree built out of ANDs,
     * ORs, and column qualifiers. The column qualifiers are simple comparisons
     * between constant values and columns in the Table Function. The Table
     * Function only returns rows which satisfy the expression. The
     * <i>restriction</i> is redundantly enforced by Derby on the rows returned
     * by the ResultSet--this means that <i>restriction</i> gives the Table
     * Function a hint about how to optimize its performance but the Table
     * Function is not required to enforce the entire <i>restriction</i>.
     * </p>
