/**
  * <P>
  *	VTICosting is the interface that the query optimizer uses
  * to cost Table Functions. The methods on this interface provide the optimizer
  * with the following information:
  * </P>
  *
  * <UL> 
  * <LI> The estimated number of rows returned by the Table Function in a single instantiation.
  * <LI> The estimated cost to instantiate and iterate through the Table Function.
  * <LI> Whether or not the Table Function can be instantiated multiple times within a single query execution.
  * </UL>
  *
  * <P>
  * The optimizer places a Table Function in the join order after making some
  * assumptions:
  * </P>
  *
  * <UL>
  * <LI><B>Cost</B> - The optimizer hard-codes a guess about how expensive
  * it is to materialize a Table Function.
  * </LI>
  * <LI><B>Count</B> - The optimizer also hard-codes a guess about how
  * many rows a Table Function returns.
  * </LI>
  * <LI><B>Repeatability</B> - The optimizer assumes that the same results
  * come back each time you invoke a Table Function.
  * </LI>
  * </Ul>
  *
  * <P>
  * The class which contains your Table Function can override these assumptions
  * and improve the join order as follows:
  * </P>
  *
  * <UL>
  * <LI><B>Implement</B> - The class must implement <a href="./VTICosting.html">VTICosting</a>.
  * </LI>
  * <LI><B>Construct</B> - The class must contain a public, no-arg constructor.
  * </LI>
  * </Ul>
  *
  * <P>
  * The methods in this interface take a <a href="./VTIEnvironment.html">VTIEnvironment</a>
  * argument. This is a state variable created by the optimizer. The methods in
  * this interface can use this state variable to pass information to one
  * another and learn other details of the operating environment.
  * </P>
