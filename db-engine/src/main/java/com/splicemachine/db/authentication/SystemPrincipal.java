 * This class represents Derby's notion of a principal, a concept of

 * An authenticated user may have other identities which make sense in
 * other code domains.
 * <p>
 * Note that principal names do NOT follow Authorization Identifier rules.
 * For instance, although edward and edWard both match the normalized
 * authorization identifier EDWARD, the instances
 * <code>SystemPrincipal("edward")</code> and
 * <code>SystemPrincipal("edWard")</code> represent different principals
 * under the methods <code>getName()</code>, <code>equals()</code>, and
 * <code>hashCode()</code>.
 * <p>
 * According to JAASRefGuide, Principal classes must implement Serializable.

     * The name of the principal.

     * Note that the name is not a "normalized" Authorization Identifier.
     * This is due to peculiarities of the Java Security Runtime, which
     * compares a <code>javax.security.auth.Subject</code>'s Principals
     * against the literal Principal name as declared in the policy files,
     * and not against the return value of method <code>getName()</code>.
     * So, a normalization of names within SystemPrincipal doesn't affect
     * permission checking by the SecurityManager.
     * <p>
     * In order for a <code>javax.security.auth.Subject</code> to be
     * granted permissions on the basis Authorization Identifier rules, e.g.,
     * for a Subject authenticated as edWard to fall under a policy clause
     * declared for EDWARD, the Subject has to be constructed (or augmented)
     * with both the literal name and the normalized Authorization Identifier.
     * <p>
     * As an alternative approach, class <code>SystemPrincipal</code> could
     * implement the non-standard interface
     * <code>com.sun.security.auth.PrincipalComparator</code>, which declares
     * a method <code>implies(Subject)<code> that would allow for Principals
     * to match Subjects on the basis of normalized Authorization Identifiers.
     * But then we'd be relying upon non-standard Security Runtime behaviour.
