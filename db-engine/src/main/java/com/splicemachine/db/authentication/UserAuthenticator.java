 * The UserAuthenticator interface provides operations to authenticate
 * a user's credentials in order to successfully connect to a database.
 * 
 * Any user authentication schemes could be implemented using this interface
 * and registered at start-up time.
 * <p>
 * If an application requires its own authentication scheme, then it can
 * implement this interface and register as the authentication scheme
 * that Derby should call upon connection requests to the system.
   See the dcoumentation for the property <I>db.authentication.provider</I>
 * <p>
 * A typical example would be to implement user authentication using
 * LDAP, Sun NIS+, or even Windows User Domain, using this interface.
 * <p>
 * <i>Note</i>: Additional connection attributes can be specified on the 
 * database connection URL and/or Properties object on jdbc connection. Values
 * for these attributes can be retrieved at runtime by the (specialized)
 * authentication scheme to further help user authentication, if one needs
 * additional info other than user, password, and database name.
