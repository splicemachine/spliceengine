/**
 * <p>
 * Logic to determine how many values to pre-allocate for a sequence.
 * By default, Derby boosts concurrency by pre-allocating ranges of numbers for sequences.
 * During orderly database shutdown, the unused numbers are reclaimed so that shutdown will
 * not create holes in the sequences.  However, holes may appear if the application fails to shut
 * down its databases before the JVM exits.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Logic in this class is called every time Derby needs to pre-allocate a new range of sequence
 * values. Users can override Derby's default behavior by writing their own implementation of this
 * interface and then setting the following Derby property:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *  -Dderby.language.sequence.preallocator=com.acme.MySequencePreallocator
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Classes which implement this interface must also provide a public 0-arg constructor so
 * that Derby can instantiate them. Derby will instantiate a SequencePreallocator for every sequence.
 * </p>
