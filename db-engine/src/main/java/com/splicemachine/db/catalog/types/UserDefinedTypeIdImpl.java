/**
 * <p>
 * This type id describes a user defined type. There are 2 kinds of user defined
 * types in Derby:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Old-fashioned</b> - In the original Cloudscape code, it was possible
 * to declare a column's type to be the name of a Java class. Unlike ANSI
 * UDTs, these user defined types were not schema objects themselves and they
 * didn't have schema-qualified names. Some of the system tables have columns
 * whose datatypes are old-fashioned user defined types. E.g., SYS.SYSALIASES.ALIASINFO.</li>
 * <li><b>ANSI</b> - As part of the work on
 * <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-651">DERBY-651</a>,
 * we added ANSI UDTs. These are user defined types which are declared via the
 * CREATE TYPE statement. These have schema-qualified names. The CREATE TYPE
 * statement basically binds a schema-qualified name to the name of a Java class.</li>
 * </ul>
