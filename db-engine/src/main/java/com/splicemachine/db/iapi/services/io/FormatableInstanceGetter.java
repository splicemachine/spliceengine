/**
 * Class that loads Formattables (typically from disk)through

 * an instance of the concrete class will be created for each format
 * identifier the class is registered for, and each instances will
 * have its setFormatId() called once with the appropriate format identifier.

 * When a Formattable object is read from disk and its registered class

 * a single set of RegisteredFormatIds per system.
