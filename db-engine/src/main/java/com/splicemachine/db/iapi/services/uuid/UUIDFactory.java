/*
	Internal comment (not for user documentation):
  Although this is an abstract interface, I believe that the
  underlying implementation of UUID will have to be DCE UUID.
  This is because the string versions of UUIDs get stored in
  the source code.  In other words, no matter what implementation
  is used for UUIDs, strings that look like this
  <blockquote><pre>
	E4900B90-DA0E-11d0-BAFE-0060973F0942
  </blockquote></pre>
  will always have to be turned into universally unique objects
  by the recreateUUID method
 */
/**
	
  Generates and recreates unique identifiers.
  
  An example of such an identifier is:
  <blockquote><pre>
	E4900B90-DA0E-11d0-BAFE-0060973F0942
  </blockquote></pre>
  These resemble DCE UUIDs, but use a different implementation.
  <P>
  The string format is designed to be the same as the string
  format produced by Microsoft's UUIDGEN program, although at
  present the bit fields are probably not the same.
