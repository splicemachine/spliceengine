     * move to the next <em>legal</em> join order in the table.
     *
     * Making sense of this call relies on understanding the performance implications
     * of joining multiple tables together. To do this, we start with an example:
     *
     * Suppose we have three tables {@code A},{@code B},and {@code C}. {@code A} has
     * 1 millions rows, {@code B} has 500,000 rows, and {@code C} has 100,000 rows. Now
     * suppose we are performing something like {@code A inner join B inner join C}, where {@code A join B}
     * will output 500K rows, and {@code B join C} will output 50K.
     *
     * We have two choices of the order of operations: {@code A join B join C} or {@code C join B join A}. If
     * we choose the first case, we will first generate an intermediate data set of {@code A join B} = 500K rows,
     * then we will filter that result set down to 50K when we perform the {@code B join C} component.
     *
     * Alternatively, we could perform the {@code C join B} component first, which will generate only 50K intermediate
     * rows. Applying the join with {@code A }afterwards, we generate {@code C join B join A} which will stll output
     * 50K rows. All things being equal, we would expect the second to be much faster (since it won't move as
     * much data around).
     *
     * Of course, all things are not equal--it may be that the access path of one table (index choice) forces
     * or allows different join strategies to be applied. Thus, in order to choose our best overall query
     * plan, we'll need to try different join orders.
     *
     * This method is responsible for generating the next join order. When all join orders are exhausted (or
     * some other consideration is taken into account), this method will return false, which indicates that no
     * more join strategies can be considered.
     *
     * Some Notes:
     *
     * 1. Not all Join permutations are legal (for example, if you are using a column which is generated
     * from the joined output results of something else as a join clause later). Implementations of this method
     * need to ensure that only <em>legal</em> join orders are allowed when called.
     *
     * 2. The method signature necessarily implies state--It is necessary for the underlying implementation
     * to store all relevant information for each permutation of the join order internally, for use within
     * the next level of optimization.
     *
     * @return boolean true  - An optimizable permutation remains.
     *                 false - Permutations are exhausted.
