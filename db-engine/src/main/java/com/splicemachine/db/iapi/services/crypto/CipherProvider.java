/**
	A CipherProvider is a wrapper for a Cipher class in JCE.

	This service is only available when run on JDK1.2 or beyond.
	To use this service, either the SunJCE or an alternative clean room
    implementation of the JCE must be installed.

	To use a CipherProvider to encrypt or decrypt, it needs 3 things:
	1) A CipherProvider that is initialized to ENCRYPT or DECRYPT
	2) A secret Key for the encryption/decryption
	3) An Initialization Vector (IvParameterSpec) that is used to create some
		randomness in the encryption

    See $WS/docs/funcspec/mulan/configurableEncryption.html
