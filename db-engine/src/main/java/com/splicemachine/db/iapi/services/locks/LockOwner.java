     * Tells whether lock requests should time out immediately if the lock

     * Normally, this method should return {@code false}, but in some very
     * special cases it could be appropriate to return {@code true}. One
     * example is when a stored prepared statement (SPS) is compiled and stored
     * in a system table. In order to prevent exclusive locks in the system
     * table from being held until the transaction that triggered the
     * compilation is finished, the SPS will be compiled in a nested
     * transaction that is committed and releases all locks upon completion.
     * There is however a risk that the transaction that triggered the
     * compilation is holding locks that the nested transaction needs, in
     * which case the nested transaction will time out. The timeout will be
     * detected by the calling code, and the operation will be retried in the
     * parent transaction. To avoid long waits in the cases where the nested
     * transaction runs into a lock conflict with its parent, the nested
     * transaction's {@code LockOwner} instance could return {@code true} and
     * thereby making it possible to detect lock conflicts instantly.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if timed waits should time out immediately,
     * {@code false} otherwise
