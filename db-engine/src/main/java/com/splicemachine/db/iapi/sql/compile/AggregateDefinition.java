 * An AggregateDefinition defines an aggregate.
 * 
 * It is used by Derby during query compilation to determine what 
 * Aggregator is used to aggregate a particular data type 
 * and what datatype the Aggregator will emit.  A single 
 * AggregateDefinition may map to one or more Aggregators 
 * depending on the input type.  For example, a user defined
 * STDEV aggregate may use one aggregator implementation for the
 * INTEGER type and another for a user defined type that implements 
 * a point.  In this case, both the aggregators would have a 
 * single AggregateDefinition that would chose the appropriate
 * aggregator based on the input type.  On the other hand, if
 * only a single aggregator is needed to aggregate over all
 * of the input types (e.g. COUNT()), then it may be convenient
 * to implement both the AggregateDefinition and the Aggregator
 * interfaces by the same class.
