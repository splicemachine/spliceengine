 * environment. They provide a convenient location for
 * storing globals organized by the module using the
 * globals. 
 * <p>
 * We provide this abstract class for other implementations
 * to use so that they can simply add fields and operations on
 * them. To be usable by the context manager, the subclasses
 * must define CleanupOnError and call super() in any constructor.
 * <p>
 * Contexts assist in cleanup
 * when errors are caught in the outer block.
 * <p>
 * Contexts implement the sanity interface to check and provide
