		<P>
		The module can check for attributes in the properties to
		see if it can fulfill the required behaviour. E.g. the raw
		store may define an attribute called RawStore.Recoverable.
		If a temporary raw store is required the property RawStore.recoverable=false
		would be added to the properties before calling bootServiceModule. If a
		raw store cannot support this attribute its canSupport method would
		return null. Also see the Monitor class's prologue to see how the
		identifier is used in looking up properties.
		<BR><B>Actually a better way maybe to have properties of the form
		RawStore.Attributes.mandatory=recoverable,smallfootprint and
		RawStore.Attributes.requested=oltp,fast
		</B>

		@return true if this instance can be used, false otherwise.
