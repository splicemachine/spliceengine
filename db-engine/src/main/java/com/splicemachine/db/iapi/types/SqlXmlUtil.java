/**
 * This class contains "utility" methods that work with XML-specific
 * objects that are only available if JAXP and/or Xalan are in
 * the classpath.
 *
 * NOTE: This class is only compiled with JDK 1.4 and higher since
 * the XML-related classes that it uses (JAXP and Xalan) are not
 * part of earlier JDKs.
 *
 * Having a separate class for this functionality is beneficial
 * for two reasons:
 *
 *    1. Allows us to allocate XML objects and compile an XML
 *       query expression a single time per statement, instead of
 *       having to do it for every row against which the query
 *       is evaluated.  An instance of this class is created at
 *       compile time and then passed to the appropriate operator
 *       implementation method in XML.java.
 *
 *    2. By keeping all XML-specific references in this one class, 
 *       we have a single "point of entry" to the XML objects--namely,
 *       the constructor for this class.  Thus, if we always make
 *       sure to check for the required XML classes _before_ calling
 *       this class's constructor, we can detect early on whether
 *       some classes (ex. Xalan) are missing, and can throw a friendly
 *       error up front, instead of a ClassNotFoundException somewhere
 *       deeper in the execution codepath.  The initial check for the
 *       required XML classes can be found in XML.checkXMLRequirements().
 *
 *       Note that we don't want to put references to XML-specific
 *       objects directly into XML.java because that class (XML.java) is
 *       instantiated anytime a table with an XML column is referenced.
 *       That would mean that if a user tried to select a non-XML column
 *       (ex. integer) from a table that had at least one XML column in
 *       it, the user would have to have JAXP and Xalan classes in
 *       his/her classpath--which we don't want.  Instead, by keeping
 *       all XML-specific objects in this one class, and then only
 *       instantiating this class when an XML operator is used (either
 *       implicitly or explicitly), we make it so that the user is only
 *       required to have XML-specific classes in his/her classpath
 *       _if_ s/he is trying to access or operate on XML values.
