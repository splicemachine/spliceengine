 * The Statement interface provides a way of giving a statement to the

 * provides some support for stored statements. Simple, non-stored,
 * non-parameterized statements can be executed with the execute() method.
 * Parameterized statements must use prepare(). To get the stored query
 * plan for a statement, use get().
 * <p>
 * This interface will have different implementations for the execution-only
 * and compile-and-execute versions of the product. In the execution-only
 * version, some of the methods will do nothing but raise exceptions to
 * indicate that they are not implemented.
 * <p>
 * There is a Statement factory in the Connection interface in the Database
 * module, which uses the one provided in LanguageFactory.
