/**

 A conglomerate is an abstract storage structure (they
 correspond to access methods).  The Conglomerate interface
 corresponds to a single instance of a conglomerate. In
 other words, for each conglomerate in the system, there
 will be one object implementing Conglomerate.
 <P>
 The Conglomerate interface is implemented by each access method.
 The implementation must maintain enough information to properly
 open the conglomerate and scans, and to drop the conglomerate.
 This information typically will include the id of the container
 or containers in which the conglomerate is stored, and my also
 include property information.
 <P>
 Conglomerates are created by a conglomerate factory.  The access
 manager stores them in a directory (which is why they implement
 Storable).
