/**

A conglomerate is an abstract storage structure (they
correspond to access methods).  The ConglomerateController interface
is the interface that access manager clients can use to manipulate
the contents of the underlying conglomerate.
<p>
Each conglomerate holds a set of rows.  Each row has a row location.
The conglomerate provides methods for:
<ul>
<li>
Inserting rows,
<li>
Fetching, deleting, and replacing entire rows by row location, and
<li>
fetching and updating individual columns of a row identified by row
location.
</ul>
<p>
Conglomerates do not provide any mechanism for associative access to
rows within the conglomerate; this type of access is provided by scans
via the ScanController interface.
<p>
Although all conglomerates have the same interface, they have different
implementations.  The implementation of a conglomerate determines some
of its user-visible semantics; for example whether the rows are ordered
or what the types of the rows' columns must be.  The implementation is
specified by an implementation id.  Currently there are two implementations,
"heap", and "btree".  The details of their behavior are specified in their
implementation documentation.  (Currently, only "heap" is implemented).
<p>
All conglomerate operations are subject to the transactional isolation
of the transaction they were opened from.  Transaction rollback will
close all conglomerates.  Transaction commit will close all non-held
conglomerates.
<p>
Scans are opened from a TransactionController.
<P>
A ConglomerateController can handle partial rows. Partial rows
are described in RowUtil.
