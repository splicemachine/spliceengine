/**
 * Generates stream headers for non-Clob string data types.
 * <p>
 * The stream header encodes the byte length of the stream. Since two bytes
 * are used for the header, the maximum encodable length is 65535 bytes. There
 * are three special cases, all handled by encoding zero into the header and
 * possibly appending an EOF-marker to the stream:
 * <ul> <li>Unknown length - with EOF marker</li>
 *      <li>Length longer than maximum encodable length - with EOF marker</li>
 *      <li>Length of zero - no EOF marker</li>
 * </ul>
 * The length is encoded like this:
 * <pre>
            out.writeByte((byte)(byteLength >>> 8));
            out.writeByte((byte)(byteLength >>> 0));
 * </pre>
