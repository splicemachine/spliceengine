 * <p>
 * This Factory is for internal items used throughout language during a
 * connection. Things that users need for the Database API are in
 * LanguageFactory in Language.Interface.

 * This factory returns (and thus starts) all the other per-database
 * language factories. So there might someday be properties as to which
 * ones to start (attributes, say, like level of optimization).
 * If the request is relative to a specific connection, the connection
 * is passed in. Otherwise, they are assumed to be database-wide services.
