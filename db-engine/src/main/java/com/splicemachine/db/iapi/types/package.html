<h2>Derby Type System</h2>
The Derby type system is mainly contained in the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">org.apache.derby.iapi.types</span>
package. The main two classes are <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor
</span>and
<span style="font-family: monospace;">DataTypeDescriptor</span>.<br>
<h3>DataValueDescriptor</h3>
Values in Derby are always represented by instances of <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">org.apache.derby.iapi.types.DataValueDescriptor</span>,
which might have
been better named <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValue</span>.
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor</span></span>, or
DVD for short, is
mainly used to represent SQL data values, though it is used for other
internal types.&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor
</span>is a Java&nbsp;
interface and in general all values are manipulated through interfaces
and not the Java class implementations such as <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">SQLInteger</span>.
DVDs are mutable
(their value can change) and can represent <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">NULL </span>or a valid value. Note
that SQL <span style="font-family: monospace;">NULL </span>is
represented by a <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor
</span>with a state of <span style="font-family: monospace;">NULL</span>,
not a <span style="font-family: monospace;">null </span>Java
reference to a <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor</span>.<br>
<br>
Generally the Derby
engine works upon an array of DVD's that represent a row, which can
correspond to a row in a table, a row in a <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">ResultSet </span>to be returned to
the application or an intermediate row in a query. The DVD's within
this array are re-used for each row processed, this is why they are
mutable. For example in&nbsp; reading rows from the store a single DVD
is used to read a column's value for all the rows processed. This is to
benefit performance, thus in a table scan of one million rows Derby
does not create one million objects, which would be the case if the
type system was immutable, like the Java object wrappers
java.lang.Integer
etc.<br>
<br>
The methods in <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor
</span>can be broken into
these groups<span style="font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"><br>
</span></span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">getXXX </span>methods
to help implement <span style="font-family: monospace;">java.sql.ResultSet.getXXX</span>
methods. Thus a <span style="font-family: monospace;">ResultSet.getInt()</span>
corresponds to the <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor.getInt()</span>
method.</li>
  <li>setValue methods to help implement <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">java.sql.PreparedStatement.setXXX</span>
methods. Thus a <span style="font-family: monospace;">PreparedStatement.setInt()</span>
corresponds to the <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor.setValue(int)</span>
method. These methods perform overflow and other range checks, e.g.
setting a <span style="font-family: monospace;">long </span>into a <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">SQLInteger </span>checks
to see that the value is within the range of an <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">int</span>, if not
an exception is thrown.<br>
These methods are also used to implement casts and other data type
conversion, thus ensuring consistent type conversions for Derby within
SQL and JDBC.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Methods to support SQL operators, e.g. <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">isNull</span>.</li>
  <li>Methods to read and write to disk, or strictly to convert the
value into a byte representation, e.g.<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">writeExternal</span>.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"></span></span>
<h4>Type Specific
Interfaces</h4>
To support operators specific to a type, or set of types, Java
interfaces that extend <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor<span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"> exist:<br>
</span></span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">NumberDataValue </span>-
Methods for operators on numeric types, such as <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">INTEGER</span>, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">DECIMAL</span>, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">REAL</span>, e.g. plus for the SQL +
operator.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">StringDataValue </span>-
Methods for operators on character types, such as <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">CHAR</span>, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">VARCHAR</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">BitDataValue </span>-
Methods for operators on binary types, such as <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">CHAR FOR BIT DATA</span>, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">BLOB</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">DateTimeDataValue </span>-
Methods for operators on character types, such as <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">CHAR</span>, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">VARCHAR</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">BooleanDataValue </span>-
Methods for operators on <span style="font-family: monospace;">BOOLEAN
    </span><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>type<span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Language Compilation</h4>
Much of the generate code for language involves the type system. E.g.
SQL operators are converted to method calls on interfaces within the
type system, such as <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDesciptor
</span>or NumberDataValue. Thus all
this generated code makes method calls through interface method calls.
The language has a policy/style of generating fields with holder
objects for the result of any operation. This holder
<span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor </span>is
then re-used for all the operations within that
query execution, thus saving object creation when the operation is
called on multiple rows. The generated code does not create the initial
value for the field, instead the operator method or <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueFactory
</span>methods create instance the first time that the result is passed
in as
<span style="font-family: monospace;">null</span>. The approximate Java
code for this would be (note the generator
generates to byte code directly).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; // instance field to
hold the result of the minus</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; private
NumberDataValue f7;</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
...</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // code within
a generated method</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; f7 = value.minus(f7);</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<br>
<h4><span style="font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;"></span></span></h4>
<h4>Interaction with
Store</h4>
The store knows little about how values represent themselves in bytes,
all that knowledge is contained within the DVD implementation.<br>
The exception is SQL <span style="font-family: monospace;">NULL </span>handling,
the store handles <span style="font-family: monospace;">NULL </span>values
consistently, as a null bit in the status byte for a field. Thus
<span style="font-family: monospace;">readExternal </span>and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">writeExternal </span>are never called
for a
<span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor </span>that
is <span style="font-family: monospace;">NULL</span>.<br>
<h4>Delayed Object Creation</h4>
When a value reads itself from its byte representation it is required
that the least amount of work is performed to obtain a useful
representation of a value. This is because the value being read from
disk may never be returned to the application, or returned but never
used by the application. The first case can occur when a qualification
in the SQL statement is executed at the language layer and not pushed
down to the store, thus the row is fetched from the store but filtered
out at the language layer. Taking <span style="font-family: monospace;">SQLDecimal
</span>as an example, the byte
format is a representation of&nbsp; a <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">java.math.BigInteger</span> instance
along with a scale. Taking the simple approach that <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">SQLDecimal </span>would
always use a java.math.BigDecimal, then this is the steps that would
occur when reading a <span style="font-family: monospace;">DECIMAL </span>column:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Read <span style="font-family: monospace;">BigInteger </span>format
into byte array, read scale</li>
  <li>New <span style="font-family: monospace;">BigInteger </span>instance
from byte array - <span style="font-weight: bold;">2 object creations
and byte array copy</span></li>
  <li>New <span style="font-family: monospace;">BigDecimal </span>instance
from BigInteger and scale - <span style="font-weight: bold;">1 object
creation</span><br>
  </li>
</ol>
Now think about a million row table scan with a DECIMAL column that
returns 1% of the rows to the application, filtering at the language
layer.<br>
<br>
This simple <span style="font-family: monospace;">SQLDecimal </span>implementation
will create 3 million objects and
do 1 million byte array copies.<br>
<br>
The smart (and current) implementation of <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">SQLDecimal </span>will delay steps 2
and 3 until there is an actual need for a <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">BigDecimal </span>object, e.g when
the application calls <span style="font-family: monospace;">ResultSet.getBigDecimal</span>.
So assuming the
application calls <span style="font-family: monospace;">getBigDecimal </span>for
every row it receives, then, since
only 1% of the rows are returned, 30,000 objects are created and 10,000
byte copies are made, thus saving 2,970,000 object creations and
990,000 byte array copies and the garbage collection overhead of those
short lived objects.<br>
<br>
This delayed object creation increases the complexity of the
<span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor </span>implementation,
but the performance benefit is well
worth it. The complexity comes from the implementation maintaining dual
state, in <span style="font-family: monospace;">SQLDecimal </span>case
the value is represented by either the raw
value, or by a <span style="font-family: monospace;">BigDecimal </span>object.
Care is taken in the implementation
to always access the value through methods, and not the fields
directly. String based values such as <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">SQLChar </span>also perform this
delayed
object creation to String, as creating a String object requires two
object creations and a char array copy. In the case of <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">SQLChar </span>though,
the raw value is maintained as a char array and not a byte array, this
is because the char[] can be used as-is as the value, e.g. in string
comparisons.<br>
<h3>DataValueFactory</h3>
Specific instances of <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor
</span>are mostly created through
the <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueFactory </span>interface.
This hides the implementation of types
from the JDBC, language and store layers. This interface includes
methods to:<br>
<ul>
  <li>generate new <span style="font-family: monospace;">NULL </span>values
for specific SQL types.<br>
  </li>
  <li>generate specific types from Java primitves or Java objects (such
as String). The returned type corresponds to the JDBC mapping for the
Java type, e.g. <span style="font-family: monospace;">SQLInteger </span>for
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">int</span>. Where the Java
type can map to
multiple SQL types there are specific methods such as getChar,
getVarchar.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></h3>
<h3>DataTypeDescriptor</h3>
The SQL type of a column, value or expression is represented by an
instance of <span style="font-family: monospace;">org.apache.derby.iapi.types.DataTypeDescriptor.</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"> DataTypeDescriptor</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"> contains three key
pieces of information:<br>
</span>
<ol>
  <li>The fundamental SQL type, e.g. <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">INTEGER</span>, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">DECIMAL, represented by a
com.splicemachine.db.iapi.types.TypeId.<br>
    </span></li>
  <li>Any length, precision or scale attributes, e.g. length for <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">CHAR</span>, precision &amp; scale for
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">DECIMAL</span>.</li>
  <li>Is the type nullable</li>
</ol>
Note that a <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor </span>is
not tied to any <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataTypeDescriptor</span>,
thus setting a value into a <span style="font-family: monospace;">DataValueDescriptor
</span>that does not conform to the intended <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">DataTypeDescriptor </span>is allowed.
The value is checked in an explict normalization phase. As an example,
an application can use <span style="font-family: monospace;">setBigDecimal()</span>
to set <span style="font-family: monospace;">199.0</span> to a
parameter that is marked as being <span style="font-family: monospace;">DECIMAL(4,2)</span>.
Only on the execute phase will the out of range exception be raised.<br>
<ol>
</ol>
<h3>Issues</h3>
<h4>Interfaces or Classes</h4>
Matching the interface type hierachy is a implementation (class)
hierachy complete with abstract types, for example DataType (again
badly named) is the abstract root for all implementations of
DataValueDescriptor, and NumberDataType for NumberDataValue. Code would
be smaller and faster if the interfaces were removed and the official
api became the public methods of these abstract classes. The work
involved here is fixing the code generation involving types, regular
java code would be compiled correctly with any change, but the
generated code needs to be change by hand, to change interface calls to
method calls. Any change like this should probably rename the abstract
classes to short descriptive names, liker DataValue and NumberValue.<br>
<h4>DataValueFactory</h4>
There is demonstrated need to hide the implementation of DECIMAL as
J2ME, J2SE and J2SE5 require different versions, thus a type
implementation factory is required. However it seems to be too generic
to have the ability to support different implementations of INTEGER,
BIGINT and some other fundemental types. Thus maybe the code could be
simplified to allow use of SQLInteger, SQLLong and others directly. At
least the SQL types that are implemented using Java primitives.<br>
<h4>Result Holder Generation</h4>
The dynamic creation of result holders (see language section) means
that all operators have to check for the result reference being passed
in being null, and if so create a new instance of the desired type.
This check seems inefficient as it will be performed once per
operation, again, imagine the million row query. In addition the field
that holds the result holder in the generated code is assigned each
time to the same value, inefficient. It seems that the code using the
type system, generated or coded, can set up the result holder at
initialization time, thus removing the need for the check and field
assignment, leading to faster smaller code.<br>
<h4>NULL and operators</h4>
The operators typically have to check for incoming NULL values and
assign the result to be NULL if any of the inputs are NULL. This
combined with the result holder generation issue leads to a lot of
duplicate code checking to see if the inputs are NULL. It's hard to
currently do this in a single method as the code needs to determine if
the inputs are NULL, generate a result holder and return two values (is
the result NULL and what is the result holder). Splitting the operator
methods into two would help as at least the NULL checks could be in the
super-class for all the types, rather than in each implementation. In
addition this would lead to the ability to generate to a more efficient
operator if the inputs are not nullable. E.g for the + operator there
could be <span style="font-family: monospace;">plus()</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">plusNotNull()</span> methods, the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">plus()</span> being implemented in the
NumberDataType class, handling NULL inputs and calling plusNotNull(),
with the plusNotNull() implemented in the specific type.<br>
<h4>Operators and self</h4>
It seems the operator methods should almost always be acting on thier
own value, e.g. the plus() method should only take one input and the
result is the value of the receiver (self) added to the input.
Currently the plus takes two inputs and probably in most if not all
cases the left input is the receiver. The result would be smaller code
and possible faster, as the method calls on self would not be through
an interface.<br>
