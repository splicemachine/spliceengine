/**

This abstract class represents a global transaction id which can be tested
for equality against other transaction ids, which can be hashed into a
hash table, and which can be output as a string. 
<P>
This class has 2 direct subclasses. 
<UL>
<LI> com.splicemachine.db.iapi.store.access.xa.XAXactId :
this class is a specific implementation of the JTA Xid interface
<LI> com.splicemachine.db.impl.store.access.GlobalXactId :
this class represents internal Derby transaction ids
</UL>
<P>
The main reason for this class is to ensure that equality etc. works in a
consistent way across both subclasses.
