/**
 * JavaFactory provides generators for Java constructs.
 * Once Java constructs have been connected into
 * a complete class definition, the class can be generated
 * from them.
 * The generated class is created as a byte-code array that
 * can then be loaded by a class loader or, in our case,
 * the class utilities wrapper around our special class loader.
 * <p>
 * Each method shows the equivalent Java in the line starting
 * "Java:" in the header comment.  Items in the java code that
 * begin with # refer to parameters used in constructing the
 * object.  So, for example, newReturnStatement takes a parameter
 * named value; its Java code is:
 * <verbatim>
   Java: return #value;
   </verbatim>
 * <p>
 * This represents the fact that newReturnStatement returns a
 * object that represents a return statement that returns the
 * value represented by the parameter named value.
 * <p>
 * REVISIT: when StandardException is moved to BasicServices,
 * all of these want to support it so they can throw
 * real NotImplementedYet exceptions. It is expected that alot
 * of this interface can be not-implemented for engines that
 * do not need this complete treatment of the language.
 * <p>
 * Known Java constructs missing from this interface include:
 * <ul>
 * <li> array initializers
 * <li> ,-lists of statements in for segments
 * <li> accessing a field of the current object or class without
 *	including this or the class name
 * <li> declaring a list of variables against one type
 * <li> conversions/coercions/promotions of types
 * <li> empty statement
 * <li> labeled statement
 * <li> switch statement
 * <li> break, continue statements
 * <li> "super" expression (akin to the "this" expression).
 * <li> operations on multi-dimensional arrays
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This interface also does not do real compilation -- there are no
 * checks for things like initialization before use of variables,
 * inclusion of catchs on throws, dead code, etc. Its purpose is to
 * let other parts of the system piece together what they know is valid
 * code and get bytecode out of doing that.
 * <p>
 * Also, implementations will require that the constructs be built
 * appropriately or they may fail to produce a valid class.  For example,
 * newStaticMethodCall must be used to call static methods only,
 * not non-static local instance methods.
 * <p>
 * Implementations may be more, or less strict.  You are best off assuming
 * you have to piece together each java construct and be as explicit as
 * possible.  So, constructors must be created with newConstructor, not
 * newMethodBuilder; constructors must include the explicit call to
 * super(...) or this(...), as their first statement; all methods and
 * constructors must contain a final return statement at the end of
 * their code path(s). Method calls will derive the method to call
 * based on the type of the argument, so you must cast arguments as
 * the system will not search for a close method and coerce arguments
 * appropriately.  This includes coercing them to be some superclass or
 * interface that they already are.
