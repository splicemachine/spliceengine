/**
 * This interface abstracts an object that implements reading and writing on a random access
 * file. It extends DataInput and DataOutput, so it implicitly contains all the methods of those
 * interfaces. Any method in this interface that also appears in the java.io.RandomAccessFile class
 * should behave as the java.io.RandomAccessFile method does.
 *<p>
 * Each StorageRandomAccessFile has an associated file pointer, a byte offset in the file. All reading and writing takes
 * place at the file pointer offset and advances it.
 *<p>
 * An implementation of StorageRandomAccessFile need not be thread safe. The database engine
 * single-threads access to each StorageRandomAccessFile instance. Two threads will not access the
 * same StorageRandomAccessFile instance at the same time.
