<h2> JMX MBeans. </h2>
When Derby (the embedded engine) is booted it will attempt to connect
to the PlatformMBeanServer and register a number of MBeans to monitor and manage Derby.
<P>
Derby registers its JMX MBeans in the <code>org.apache.derby</code> domain and
always includes values for <code>type</code> and <code>system</code> in the MBean's ObjectName's key
properties. Other key properties are described in the interface class for the MBean.
<UL>
<LI> <code>type</code> Set to the class name of the MBean's interface class without
the package and without <code>MBean</code>. E.g. for <code>org.apache.derby.mbeans.VersionMBean</code>
the key property <code>type</code> will be set to <code>Version</code>. The javadoc for each MBean
also indicates what <code>type</code> will be set to.
<LI> <code>system</code> Set to a runtime identifier that allows Derby and applications
to disambiguate multiple Derby systems in the same virtual machine but different class loaders.
Currently a new value is created each time Derby is booted. An application may discover the
value of the identifier by registering the MBean <code>org.apache.derby.mbeans.Management</code>
and accessing the <code>SystemIdentifier</code>. This application created <code>ManagementMBean</code>
must be running in the same class loader as Derby.
</UL>
<P>
Derby registers the class name for any MBean to be the interface class for the MBean
(i.e. <code>org.apache.derby.mbeans.*MBean</code>) to hide the implementation class
(which is subject to change). Permissions in policy files therefore need to
use the MBean interface to define fine grained access. E.g. the permission 
to allow a invoking the <code>startManagement</code> of the <code>ManagementMBean</code>
may be written as:
<pre>
permission javax.management.MBeanPermission
    "org.apache.derby.mbeans.ManagementMBean#startManagement[org.apache.derby:*]",
    "invoke";
</pre>
<P>
If Derby cannot connect to the PlatformMBeanServer then no MBeans will be registered.
Applications may use the <code>org.apache.derby.mbeans.Management</code> MBean to
later enable Derby's JMX management.
<P>
If Derby cannot register a specific MBean (e.g. due to no permission to register
that MBean) then it will simply be ignored. Subsequent re-starts of Derby's
management service through <code>org.apache.derby.mbeans.ManagementMBean</code> will
attempt to register such an MBean again (assuming it is still valid),
in case the security policy has been updated.
