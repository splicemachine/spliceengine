This section describes TestNist (NIST Integration Test)

- TestNist: Run all SQL script in the src/test/resourced/nist folder with derby, splice and do script output
            differencing.  Runs just less than 4 min.  When run this way, a splice server must be running ahead
            of starting the test.

   - To run manually... (splice server must be running)

   USAGE: mvn clean install -Dtest=TestNist [-Dnoclean] [-Dscript=<scriptName.sql>] [-P <platform>]
   Where: noclean => do not clean the Derby and Splice DB schema. Default is to remove all foreign schema before and
                after run.
          script=<scriptName.sql> => run the Nist script noted (plus schema creation scripts before).
          platform => build and run the test on the given HBase platform.  Default platform is cloudera-cdh4.3.0.
                Available platforms are "hdp1.3" - HortonWorks, "mapr-0.94.5" - MapR and "apache-hbase-0.94.5" - vanilla
                HBase. Note that you must have already built (clean install) the given platform.
          
   Notes:
    - Test difference report output goes into NistIT.log
    - To build, in the splicemachine/structured_test directory, run "> mvn clean install -DskipTests"
    - Note that if you just run "> mvn test", that will run NistIT (the main test) and all tests in
            the project and Splice tests may fail because schema and tables already exist.

This section describes TestNist (NIST Integration Test)

   - This runs as a Maven Profile... (starts/stops server for you)

   USAGE: mvn clean install -P [<profile>,]apache-derby,integration-tests
        Will run all tests, unit and integ, starting and stopping the splice server for you.

    Notes:
     - Test difference report output goes into NistIT.log
     - apache-derby profile is given so that Derby test running code has access to vanilla Derby jars.

This section describes the Nist testing overall

- Structure
   - Control files located in src/test/resources/nist
       - skip.tests file is there for you to list tests to skip.
       - schema.list file is there for you to list all tests that create schema. These are placed
            at the front of the list of tests to run, because other tests depend on these schema to exist.
       - derby.filter is the place to put errors, warnings and other output from Derby that you want
            ignored for output file differencing.
       - splice.filter is the same as derby.filter except it's for Splice output.
       - The other area of test output normalization is in NistLineEqualizer. This is an implementation of the
            Equalizer<T> interface provided by the differencing module we use.
   - Flow
       - To get the list and the order (yes, there is a required order) of .sql scripts to run,
            we get the list of all .sql scripts in the src/test/resources/nist directory, remove the skipped
            tests using the list in skip.tests, remove the schema creators using the list in schema.list, sort
            the remainder in alpha order and add the schema creators to the front of the list.
       - Execute the list against Derby with DerbyNistRunner, which produces target/nist/<scriptName>.derby
       - Execute the list against Splice with SpliceNistRunner, which produces target/nist/<scriptName>.splice
       - Difference the .derby files with the .splice files, which produces a collection of DiffReports
       - Clean up schema created in both Derby and Splice. This is done by querying for schema from the JDBC
            Connection and, for each schema, query for and remove the Views, Tables and finally the schema.
            (See caveats)
       - Print all DiffReports to a file and fail the test if any have differences
       - Durations are given for Derby and Splice execution time

- Left to do (caveats)
   - Splice reestablish connection not working
       - I have code in place to check if a connection gets closed and, if so, create a new one, and it works 
            for Derby embedded connection, but not for Splice. 
       - To work around this, I have commented the "disconnect;" directives in basetab.sql, schema1.sql and
            schema5.sql for now.
   - The schema cleanup does not always work. Although Views are dropped first from each schema, there are some
       schemas that have Views that are dependent on other views. If an attempt is made to drop a view on which
       another view is dependent, the View drop fails and then, of course, the schema drop fails.  Usually it
       is not a problem to run ITs twice because the clean that runs before the test removes dangling schema
       that the post test cleanup failed to remove.
   - Getting maven to launch the Splice server (with splice derby jars) AND to run tests against vanilla Derby
       (acquire embedded connection, etc) in the same Java VM is not working.  If the splice sever is started
       manually, one test can be run to exec sql scripts against both vanilla Derby, Splice Machine server,
       compare and report results. This is how the TestNist test works. This works because the derby client
       jars are running in separate VMs. To run Nist test scripts against both vanilla Derby and Splice in the
       same VM, two test classes have to be run. The first, DerbyNistTest, is run against vanilla Derby and its
       output written to target/nist. Then the splice server is started and SpliceNistIT is run against the
       splice server with its output going to target/nist. At the end of SpliceNistIT the derby results are
       compared to the splice results and the NistIT.log report is written.
