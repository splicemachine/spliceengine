This is the directory in which to place sql scripts for adhoc testing.  Scripts are run against both Derby
and Splice.  The output is differenced and a report is generated.

Just throw sql files (with ".sql" extension) in this directory and run SpliceDerbyAdhocIT. The splice server must be running.

See SpliceDerbyAdhocIT and adhoc.sql.example in this directory.
