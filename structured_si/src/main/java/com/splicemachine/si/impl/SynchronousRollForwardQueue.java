/**
 * Collect "roll-forward" requests for a given table. Accumulate these by transaction ID. At regular intervals
 * asynchronously execute roll-forwards on a per transaction basis. A roll-forward request is an update to the SI
 * metadata on a data row to reflect the final transaction status for a given transaction.
 * <p/>
 * The core asynchronous mechanism is implemented by scheduling future tasks on the scheduler.
 * <p/>
 * Roll-forward requests are generated both as rows are written within transactions and as rows are read. It is possible
 * that when the roll-forward action is executed, the transaction has not yet reached a final state. In these cases the
 * roll-forward request is ignored by the lower level code.
 * <p/>
 * The roll-forward actions are executed in a "best effort" manner. That is, it is acceptable for them to not be run.
 * The SI algorithms will still be correct in these cases. If a roll-forward request is ignored then it is expected that
 * a later request will be generated (e.g. the next time the row is read or compacted).
 * <p/>
 * This is closely related to the "roll-forward" that occurs at HBase compaction time, but that logic follows a
 * different code path.
 * <p/>
 * One of these is created for each HBase region. It needs to be thread-safe, since many concurrent threads can
 * generate roll-forward requests for the region. Therefore, pay particular attention to the synchronized blocks below.
 * They are written to provide crisp semantics, to avoid concurrent changes to the underlying queue, and to only have as
 * much code as required inside of the synchronized blocks. All of the mutable state is accessed from inside of
 * synchronized blocks.
