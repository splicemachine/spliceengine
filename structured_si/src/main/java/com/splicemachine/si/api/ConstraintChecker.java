/**
 * Hook for external systems to apply constraint checking based on rows returned during conflict detection.
 *
 * This serves multiple purposes:
 *
 * 1. Efficiency: A row only needs to be fetched a single time, and is then passed through Conflict detection
 * AND constraint checks. This minimizes the amount of IO needed to perform a constraint check.
 * 2. Correctness: Due to the concurrency of the write pipeline, some constraints are only correct if they are
 * applied synchronously (that is, within the HBase row lock). This mechanism guarantees that there is a mechanism
 * to properly apply that constraint.
