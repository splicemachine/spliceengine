/**
 * Upon any connection on port 6666 calls shutdown on MiniHBaseCluster.
 * <p/>
 * Allows one to shutdown SpliceTestPlatform from the command line.  Using netcat for example: 'nc localhost 6666'
 * <p/>
 * Why not use HbaseAdmin here?  Apparently the work necessary to cleanly shutdown a MiniHBaseCluster is a superset
 * of of what HbaseAdmin.shutdown does.  MiniHBaseCluster.shutdown() invokes the normal Hbase shutdown stuff plus
 * whatever else is unique to the MiniHBaseCluster.
 * <p/>
 * Note that this will kill all region servers if you have started multiple using our spliceClusterMember profile.
 * <p/>
 * A quick way to test that this mechanism is working:  If you comment out all coprocessor in SpliceTestPlatformConfig
 * start SpliceTestPlatform and then 'nc localhost 60000' should should see the SpliceTestPlatform completely shutdown
 * and the JVM exit in about two seconds.  It this works, but the same does not happen when the coprocessors are
 * enabled, then something in splice is keeping the JVM alive.
