# This file contains SQL fragments that are used as
# part of the ODBC metadata generation process.
# This file is NOT, and is NOT intended to become,
# an ODBC substitute for metadata.properties.
# Rather, it is a place to store fragments of ODBC
# metadata statements that do not apply to JDBC
# metadata, but which are used as part of the ODBC
# metadata generation process (these fragments are
# plugged into the ODBC versions of the queries for
# which they are required).  When all is done,
# the fragments in this file will show up as part
# of the generated ODBC metadata queries, which
# will then be appended to Derby's internal list
# of metadata queries (in metadata.properties),
# which will, finally, serve as the basis for
# for both JDBC and ODBC metadata calls.
#
# This file, like the ODBCMetadataGenerator class
# that uses it, is ONLY USED AT BUILD TIME; and 
# like the ODBCMetadataGenerator class, it is NOT
# included in the final com.splicemachine.db package
# (and thus will NOT be included in the Derby jar
# file).
#
# Note: In this file, words between curly brackets
# (ex "{SQL_DATA_TYPE_FOR_ODBC}") are placeholders
# for other fragments in this file.  The actual
# substitutions for these placeholders occur as
# part of the ODBCMetadataGenerator class's work.
#
# Finally, note that starting a line in this file
# with the "\\\n" sequence allows formatting (esp.
# tabs and newlines) to be preserved, so that the
# generated ODBC queries are human-readable.

# as part of the JDBC subquery's result set.

# to return a generic "SQL_DATETIME" value here;
# that's defined as the value "9".  All other
