=========================================================
Download URL - Single Unclustered Instance
=========================================================

To download the setup for the unclustered instance, use a web browser to navigate to the 
following (approx. 80 MB):

   http://d10sdxe2fhfs9c.cloudfront.net/splice_machine-0.5rc6-cloudera-cdh4.3.0_simple.tar.gz
   
If you use Linux without a web browser, you can use the "wget <file>" command to get the 
file:

   $ wget http://d10sdxe2fhfs9c.cloudfront.net/splice_machine-0.5rc6-cloudera-cdh4.3.0_simple.tar.gz
	

===================================================================
Download URL - Cloudera Parcel Directory for Clustered Installs
===================================================================

The URL for the Custom Repository is as follows:
http://d10sdxe2fhfs9c.cloudfront.net

(IMPORTANT: Remember to hit the "Add" button in the setup process.)  

When prompted be sure to select the RC6 version:

CDH-4.3.0-1.chd4.3.0.splice0.5rc6.22-precise

============================================================
Download URL - sqlshell.sh script for Clustered Installs
============================================================

Start by using the sqlshell.sh script (downloaded at:
http://d10sdxe2fhfs9c.cloudfront.net/sqlshell.sh )

After downloading, run "chmod u+x sqlshell.sh" to make the script executable.

=====================================
Download URL - Sample Data
=====================================

Compressed, this is about 200MB of data.  The link to access this data is at:
	http://d10sdxe2fhfs9c.cloudfront.net/demodata.tar.gz

A list of known bugs and other issues
=========================================

- IMPORTANT REMINDER FOR CLUSTER USERS: If you import data like the examples shown with the sample data, you must FIRST
copy your sample data into HDFS (using copyFromLocal, etc), then change the paths to the HDFS path specified.

- AWS/EC2 CLUSTER users - it is important to use the "Public DNS" of the instance when specifying hosts for the CDH
cluster installation.  For example, use ec2-54-243-14-239.compute-1.amazonaws.com - not 54.243.14.239.  Also
you should not stop and restart a server once you have created your cluster since AWS will use different IP
addresses after restart, and will corrupt your cluster.

- IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LAPTOP USERS: If you are running the database on a laptop, you will need to stop and 
restart the database after closing and reopening the laptop.

- The scripts used to start and stop the Splice database do NOT handle directories with spaces in them. 
Please be sure to create directories without spaces or other special characters.

- Before importing data files, it is recommended that you compress them first using gzip.

- Certain features are not available as part of the 0.5 release but are expected to follow soon.  These include:
  - Users/roles/security
  - Cursors
  - Foreign key constraints
  - Triggers
  - Temporary tables
  - Materialized views
  - table truncation

- If you create a long-running query that you want to kill, typing Control-C at the prompt won't kill the query.
If necessary you can stop and restart the database, or just start another query interface session in another
terminal window using ./bin/sqlshell.sh.

- Certain DDL actions are not fully complete and/or do not maintain full transactional integrity.  It is best to 
execute DDL statements separately from DML statements for now.

- Complex nested joins (select * from d join (a left outer join (b join c on b1=c1) on a1 = a2) on d3 = b3)
  can fail.

- You currently cannot create an index on more than 16 columns.

- If you have an autogenerated column, you cannot import into the table and have the autogenerate work properly.

- Restarting the database sometimes takes a couple of attempts.  The start and stop scripts will retry if needed.  If restarting
does not occur, check the splice.log.  If you see an exception but no "ready to accept connections", please retry the command.  
You are ready to go when you see the "ready to accept connections" message.
