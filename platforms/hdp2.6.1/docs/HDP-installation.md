# Installing and Configuring Splice Machine for Hortonworks HDP

This topic describes installing and configuring Splice Machine on a
Hortonworks Ambari-managed cluster. Follow these steps:

1. [Verify Prerequisites](#verify-prerequisites)
2. [Download and Install Splice Machine](#download-and-install-splice-machine)
3. [Stop Hadoop Services](#stop-hadoop-services)
4. [Configure Hadoop Services](#configure-hadoop-services)
5. [Start Any Additional Services](#start-any-additional-services)
6. Make any needed [Optional Configuration Modifications](#optional-configuration-modifications)
7. [Verify your Splice Machine Installation](#verify-your-splice-machine-installation)

## Verify Prerequisites

Before starting your Splice Machine installation, please make sure that
your cluster contains the prerequisite software components:

* A cluster running HDP
* Ambari installed and configured for HDP
* HBase installed
* HDFS installed
* YARN installed
* ZooKeeper installed
* Ensure that Phoenix services are **NOT** installed on your cluster, as
  they interfere with Splice Machine HBase settings.

**NOTE:** The specific versions of these components that you need depend on your
operating environment, and are called out in detail in the
[Requirements](https://doc.splicemachine.com/onprem_info_requirements.html) topic of our *Getting Started Guide*.

## Download and Install Splice Machine

Setup local yum repo on ambari server node ( or a node that all the nodes in the cluster can access) :

0.make sure there is a http server on the node that your_node_url is accessable.

1.make sure createrepo is installed on the node ( use 'yum install createrepo' to confirm)

2.put the splicemachine rpm under /var/www/html/ambari-repo/ ( or the path you choose)

3.use 'createrepo /var/www/html/ambari-repo/' to create the repo metadata

4.open the url your_node_url/ambari-repo to confirm it can be accessed by yum

5.put a file named splicemachine.repo under /etc/yums.repo.d/

the content is as below 

  ````
  [splicemachine]
  name=SpliceMachine Repo
  baseurl=http://your_node_url/ambari-repo
  enabled=1
  gpgcheck=0
  ````
  
6. rum yum list | grep splicemachine to make sure the custom repo is up and running.  

Perform the following steps **on each node** in your cluster:

1.  install the splicemachine  custom ambari service rpm using following command (take version 2.5.0.1811 for example) :

    ````
    sudo yum install splicemachine_ambari_service
    ````

After install the rpm,restart ambari-server using 'service ambari-server restart'

6.please click next all the way down to this page ,then click 'deploy',after that finishes,splice machine is installed.

<img src="docs/review.jpeg" alt="dependent_config.jpeg" width="400" height="200">

7.restart all the services affected to start splice machine!



## Start any Additional Services

We started this installation by shutting down your cluster services, and
then configured and restarted each individual service used by Splice
Machine.

If you had any additional services running, such as Ambari Metrics, you
need to restart each of those services.

## Optional Configuration Modifications

There are a few configuration modifications you might want to make:

* [Modify the Authentication Mechanism](#modify-the-authentication-mechanism) if you want to
  authenticate users with something other than the default *native
  authentication* mechanism.
* [Modify the Log Location](#modify-the-log-location) if you want your Splice Machine
  log entries stored somewhere other than in the logs for your region
  servers.

### Modify the Authentication Mechanism

Splice Machine installs with Native authentication configured; native
authentication uses the `sys.sysusers` table in the `splice` schema for
configuring user names and passwords.

You can disable authentication or change the authentication mechanism
that Splice Machine uses to LDAP by following the simple instructions in
[Configuring Splice Machine
Authentication](https://doc.splicemachine.com/onprem_install_configureauth.html){: .WithinBook}

If you're using Kerberos, you need to add this option to your HBase Master Java Configuration Options:

   ````
   -Dsplice.spark.hadoop.fs.hdfs.impl.disable.cache=true
   ````
### Enabling Ranger for Authorization

Splice Machine installs with Native authorization configured; native
authorization uses the Splice Machine dictionary tables to determine permissions on database objects.

Before changing the authorization scheme, the Splice Machine ranger service needs to be installed.  As part of the Splice Machine Ambari Service, 
the admin plugin for Splice Machine is added to the Ranger web application.

The service can be installed by executing the following from a command line on the machine where the Ambari Service resides.

```
curl -sS -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:6080/service/plugins/definitions -d @/home/splice/ranger-servicedef-splicemachine.json
```


The configuration of Ranger occurs as part of the configuration for the Splice Machine service.  There are two key configurations for the audit and the security settings.

<img src="docs/ranger_splicemachine_audit.jpeg" alt="ranger_splicemachine_audit.jpeg" width="400" height="200">

Audit functionality in the xml is **off** by default.  To configure, select the _xasecure.audit.is.enabled_ box and then select whether you want SOLR, HDFS, or both.  The properties will need to modified by hand.

<img src="docs/ranger_splicemachine_security.jpeg" alt="ranger_splicemachine_security.jpeg" width="400" height="200">

The security configuration requires that _ranger.plugin.splicemachine.service.name_ be set to the name of the service in the Ranger UI.


The following policy is required so SYSIBM routines can support database connectivity.

| Required Policy Name | Logic | Users |
|--------------|------|------|
| SYSIBM| `Schema=SYSIBM,routine=*,permissions=execute` | `All users/groups that will use the database`


##### Configurations

Once this is done, you can change the authorization scheme to RANGER by adding this option to your HBase Region Server Java Configuration Options:

   ````
   -Dsplice.authorization.scheme=RANGER
   ````

It is set to **NATIVE** by default.

#### Query Statement log

Splice Machine logs all SQL statements by default, storing the log
entries in your region server's logs, as described in our [Using
Logging](developers_tuning_logging) topic. You can modify where Splice
Machine stores logs by adding the following snippet to your *RegionServer Logging
Advanced Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve)* section of your HBase
Configuration:

   ````
   log4j.appender.spliceDerby=org.apache.log4j.FileAppender
   log4j.appender.spliceDerby.File=${hbase.log.dir}/splice-derby.log
   log4j.appender.spliceDerby.layout=org.apache.log4j.EnhancedPatternLayout
   log4j.appender.spliceDerby.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{EEE MMM d HH:mm:ss,SSS} Thread[%t] %m%n

   log4j.appender.spliceStatement=org.apache.log4j.FileAppender
   log4j.appender.spliceStatement.File=${hbase.log.dir}/splice-statement.log
   log4j.appender.spliceStatement.layout=org.apache.log4j.EnhancedPatternLayout
   log4j.appender.spliceStatement.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{EEE MMM d HH:mm:ss,SSS} Thread[%t] %m%n

   log4j.logger.splice-derby=INFO, spliceDerby
   log4j.additivity.splice-derby=false

   # Uncomment to log statements to a different file:
   #log4j.logger.splice-derby.statement=INFO, spliceStatement
   # Uncomment to not replicate statements to the spliceDerby file:
   #log4j.additivity.splice-derby.statement=false
   ````
   
#### OLAP Server Log
   
Splice Machine uses log4j to config OLAP server's log.  If you want to change the default log behavior of OLAP server,
config `splice.olap.log4j.configuration` in `hbase-site.xml`. It specifies the log4j.properties file you want to use.
This file needs to be available on HBase master server.


## Verify your Splice Machine Installation

Now start using the Splice Machine command line interpreter, which is
referred to as `the splice prompt` or simply `splice&gt;` by launching the
`sqlshell.sh` script on any node in your cluster that is running an HBase region server.

The command line interpreter defaults to connecting on port `1527` on
`localhost`, with username `splice`, and password `admin`. You can
override these defaults when starting the interpreter, as described in
the [Command Line (splice&gt;) Reference](https://doc.splicemachine.com/cmdlineref_intro.html) topic
in our *Developer's Guide*.

Now try entering a few sample commands you can run to verify that
everything is working with your Splice Machine installation.

   <table>
    <col />
    <col />
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Operation</th>
            <th>Command to perform operation</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Display tables</td>
            <td><code>splice&gt; show tables;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Create a table</td>
            <td><code>splice&gt; create table test (i int);</code></td>

            <td>Add data to the table</td>
            <td><code>splice&gt; insert into test values 1,2,3,4,5;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Query data in the table</td>
            <td><code>splice&gt; select * from test;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Drop the table</td>
            <td><code>splice&gt; drop table test;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Exit the command line interpreter</td>
            <td><code>splice&gt; exit;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2"><strong>Make sure you end each command with a semicolon</strong> (<code>;</code>), followed by the <em>Enter</em> key or <em>Return</em> key </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
   </table>
