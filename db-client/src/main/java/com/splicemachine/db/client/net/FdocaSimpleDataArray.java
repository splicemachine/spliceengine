    // ccsid into binary form generates the four byte representation.  The

    // this is used to specify mode of interpretation of FD:OCA
    // architecture for all variable length data types (including null
    // terminated), that as the SBCS variable character type.  The
    // low order bit of this byte is used to control interpretation
    // of Length Fields in SDAs for variable length types.  A '0' in that
    // bit indicates that non-zero length field values indicate the space
    // reserved for data and that all the space is transmitted
    // whether or not it contains valid data.  In the case of variable
    // length types, the first two bytes of the data itself determine
    // the valid data length.  A '1' in this bit shows that non-zero length
    // field values indicate the maximum value of the length fields
    // that the data will contain.  Only enough space to contain each
    // data value is transmitted for each value.
    int mode_;

    // this represents the maximum valid value.  when and if a group
    // data array (GDA) triplet overrides it, the value can be reduced.
    // For character fields with only DBCS characters, this is the length in
    // characters (bytes/2).  For all other cases, the length is in bytes.
    // It does not include the length of the length field (variable length
    // types) or null indicator (nullable types).
    //
    int fieldLength_;

    // this is a group of types which indicates how the data length are computed.
