        <p>Core client side JDBC statement cache implementation files. The
        purpose of the client side JDBC statement cache is primarily to avoid
        the performance penalty of going over the network from the client to
        the server when preparing a statement that has already been prepared
        on the same connection.</p>

      <h2>Core cache implementation</h2>
        <p>The core cache implementation has three responsibilities:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Hold items in the cache</b>
                <p>The current implementation stores either
                <tt>PreparedStatement</tt>s or <tt>CallableStatement</tt>s in
                the cache. A key is computed for each item, and there can only
                by one instance of an item per key.</p></li>
            <li><b>Determine if an item is in the cache, and if so return it</b>
                <p>When a statement is prepared, the cache is consulted to
                see if there is already a statement available. All statements
                in the cache are by design free and available for use. A key
                for the statement is computed to do the lookup. If there is a
                statement available, it is taken out from the cache. When the
                client is done with the statement, the cache is consulted again
                to see if an identical statement (with the same key) has been
                inserted. If so, the statement is closed. If not, it is
                reinserted into the cache. This procedure allows us to use the
                LRU algorithm for eviction.</p></li>
            <li><b>Throw out items when the cache capacity is exceeded</b>
                <p>A LRU (least recently used) algorithm is used to select
                which item to throw out. When a statement is thrown out, it is
                permanently closed and all references to the object are
                released.</p></li>
        </ol></p>

      <h2>Behavioral implications</h2>
        <p>When the JDBC cache is enabled, there is one difference in behavior.
        Some errors that were previously encountered during the prepare call,
        might now happen during execute. As an example, consider a statement
        referring a deleted table.</p>
        <p>Say table <tt>A</tt> is created and populated, then queried using a
        prepared statement. This statement will be cached. If table <tt>A</tt>
        is later deleted, the prepared query referring to it will not be
        invalidated. If the query is prepared again on the same connection,
        the cached object will be fetched from the cache and the prepare seems
        to have succeeded (it actually hasn't been performed). When the prepared
        statement is executed, the error is detected on the server side and the
        client is notified.</p>

      <h2>Performance considerations and requirements</h2>
        <p>In order to allow for improved performance from using the JDBC
        statement cache, there are three requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable the JDBC statement cache. Currently, this can only be
                done when using <tt>ClientConnectionPoolDataSource</tt>.</li>
            <li>Use prepared or callable statements to interact with the
                database.</li>
            <li>Close the statements to return them to the cache. This happens
                automatically when the logical connection is closed, but
                must (and should) be done explicitly to fully utilize the cache
                within a single logical connection.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Using the JDBC statement cache will make each physical connection
        use more memory. The amount depends on how many statements the
        connection is allowed to cache and how many statements are actually
        cached.</p>

      <h2>Enabling the cache through JDBC</h2>
        <p>Currently, the JDBC statement cache can only be enabled by using
        <tt>ClientConnectionPoolDataSource</tt>. Sample code:</p>
        <pre>
ClientConnectionPoolDataSource cpds = new ClientConnectionPoolDataSource();
// Set the number of statements the cache is allowed to cache.
// Any number greater than zero will enable the cache.
cpds.setMaxStatements(20);
// This physical connection will have JDBC statement caching enabled.
PooledConnection pc = cpds.getPooledConnection();
// Create a logical connection.
Connection con = pc.getConnection();
// Interact with the database.
PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement(
    "select * from myTable where id = ?");
...
ps.close(); // Inserts/returns statement to the cache
...
con.close();

// The next logical connection can gain from using the cache.
con = pc.getConnection();
// This prepare will cause a statement to be fetched from the local cache.
PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement(
    "select * from myTable where id = ?");
...

// This disposes of the cache.
pc.close();
        </pre>


      <h2>Implementation note</h2>
        <p>The client XA connection pool reuses the same code as the
        connection pool data source, and enabling the JDBC statement cache
        for XA connections is a matter of changing a few lines of code.
        However, it has not been investigated whether the XA aspect requires
        something more with regards to statement caching.</p>

        <p>The main JIRA issue for the client side JDBC statement cache is
        <a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-3313'>DERBY-3313</a>.
