/**
 * ClientDataSource40 is a simple data source implementation
 * that can be used for establishing connections in a
 * non-pooling, non-distributed environment.
 * The class ClientConnectionPoolDataSource40 can be used in a connection pooling environment,
 * and the class ClientXADataSource40 can be used in a distributed, and pooling
 * environment. Use these DataSources if your application runs at
 * JDBC level 4.0 (or higher). Use the corresponding ClientDataSource, ClientConnectionPoolDataSource, and
 * ClientXADataSource classes if 
 * your application runs in the following environments:
 * <p/>
 *	<UL>
 *	<LI> JDBC 3.0 - Java 2 - JDK 1.4, J2SE 5.0
 *	<LI> JDBC 2.0 - Java 2 - JDK 1.2,1.3
 * </UL>
 *
 * <p>The example below registers a DNC data source object with a JNDI naming service.
 * <pre>
 * com.splicemachine.db.client.ClientDataSource40 dataSource = new com.splicemachine.db.client.ClientDataSource40 ();
 * dataSource.setServerName ("my_derby_database_server");
 * dataSource.setDatabaseName ("my_derby_database_name");
 * javax.naming.Context context = new javax.naming.InitialContext();
 * context.bind ("jdbc/my_datasource_name", dataSource);
 * </pre>
 * The first line of code in the example creates a data source object.
 * The next two lines initialize the data source's
 * properties. Then a Java object that references the initial JNDI naming
 * context is created by calling the
 * InitialContext() constructor, which is provided by JNDI.
 * System properties (not shown) are used to tell JNDI the
 * service provider to use. The JNDI name space is hierarchical,
 * similar to the directory structure of many file
 * systems. The data source object is bound to a logical JNDI name
 * by calling Context.bind(). In this case the JNDI name
 * identifies a subcontext, "jdbc", of the root naming context
 * and a logical name, "my_datasource_name", within the jdbc
 * subcontext. This is all of the code required to deploy
 * a data source object within JNDI. This example is provided
 * mainly for illustrative purposes. We expect that developers
 * or system administrators will normally use a GUI tool to
 * deploy a data source object.
 * <p/>
 * Once a data source has been registered with JNDI,
 * it can then be used by a JDBC application, as is shown in the
 * following example.
 * <pre>
 * javax.naming.Context context = new javax.naming.InitialContext ();
 * javax.sql.DataSource dataSource = (javax.sql.DataSource) context.lookup ("jdbc/my_datasource_name");
 * java.sql.Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection ("user", "password");
 * </pre>
 * The first line in the example creates a Java object
 * that references the initial JNDI naming context. Next, the
 * initial naming context is used to do a lookup operation
 * using the logical name of the data source. The
 * Context.lookup() method returns a reference to a Java Object,
 * which is narrowed to a javax.sql.DataSource object. In
 * the last line, the DataSource.getConnection() method
 * is called to produce a database connection.
 * <p/>
 * This simple data source subclass of ClientBaseDataSource maintains
 * it's own private <code>password</code> property.
 * <p/>
 * The specified password, along with the user, is validated by DERBY.
 * This property can be overwritten by specifing
 * the password parameter on the DataSource.getConnection() method call.
 * <p/>
 * This password property is not declared transient, and therefore
 * may be serialized to a file in clear-text, or stored
 * to a JNDI server in clear-text when the data source is saved.
 * Care must taken by the user to prevent security
 * breaches.
 * <p/>
