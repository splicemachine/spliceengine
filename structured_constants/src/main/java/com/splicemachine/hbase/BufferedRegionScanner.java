/**
 * Buffers Region writes.
 *
 * There are two scalability concerns with the raw HBase RegionScanner.
 *
 * The first is that reads aren't buffered, which means each read must access the Memstore directly,
 * which may require additional IO (disk seeks, etc.).
 *
 * The second is that each call to regionScanner.next() involves a synchronization step--a read lock
 * must be acquired by the region, and then released. Since we may potentially be doing this over a
 * large portion of the table, this results in a large number of locks and unlocks.
 *
 * One naive way to resolve the locking issue is to just acquire a read lock with the first row in
 * the scan, then release it after the last read has completed. However, this causes additional
 * scalability issues: the read lock that is acquired will block any attempts to write to that
 * region until the scan has completed, which may be a very long time. This will murder attempts
 * to provide reasonable update performance for most tables which are under heavy read load, and is
 * also generally a bad idea.
 *
 * To make matters worse, there is only one thread which will call next() at a time, <em>but it isn't
 * always the same thread!</em> This means that, even though we know that only one thread will be
 * calling our code at a time (which would otherwise not require synchronization), we are still
 * communicating information across multiple threads (in the form of read state, etc.) and thus
 * must be thread safe.
 *
 * So, to recap: we must have a region scanner which has the following properties:
 *
 * 1. Thread-safe
 * 2. Buffering (hold a buffer of results in memory so that repeated access is not required)
 * 3. Does not hold a region lock for longer than is necessary.
 * 4. Amortized nonblocking (e.g. nonblocking <em>most of the time</em>)
 *
 * This class provides such an implementation, mostly by using a {@link ConcurrentRingBuffer}
 * as our buffering abstraction.
